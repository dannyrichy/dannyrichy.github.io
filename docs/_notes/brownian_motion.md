## Brownian Motion

#### Whazzat!

A brownian motion is the simplest stochastic process that is constructed. This is often used to construct stochastic differential equation


#### Use cases

- Using **Dirichlet distribution** as means to sample a probability values for categorical distribution allows one to control heterogeneity. Fo instance having constant vector $$ \mathbf{\alpha} \approx 0 $$ would give highly heterogeneous sample as compared to $$ \mathbf{\alpha} \approx 10^6 $$.
