#### Whazzat
SLT is the study of bounding generalizability error

#### Take-away
This line of study makes me feel like I understand it, but at the same time, I still have many unanswered questions. What I gathered from this work is that there is a distinction between empirical risk (the average loss over a sample of data) and true risk (the expected loss over the entire distribution of data). It's often difficult to directly evaluate the true risk, so the aim is to define bounds on the empirical risk that reflect how close it is to the true risk, thus providing insight into the modelâ€™s generalizability.
