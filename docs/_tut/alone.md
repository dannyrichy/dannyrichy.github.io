Indeed, why do we do the things we do? Why do some actions, which make absolutely no sense rationally, still give us a sense of well-being, like rituals? Perhaps what [Byung-Chul Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byung-Chul_Han){:target="_blank"} (Source: Philosophize this podcast) suggests is not merely a nudge to stick to our roots but rather an invitation to question why the rituals we were raised with bring us peace. Or do they only bring us peace after we’ve gone through a rebellious phase?

Maybe the story of the prodigal son is meant to show us that the true reward lies in exploring and discovering for ourselves that what we were told was true all along. Or perhaps this line of thought only applies to things that align with it, much like survivor bias. Whatever its original intent, I interpret it as a mechanism to temper our innate urge to explore new realms. And while my language might make this seem like a bad thing, I see it as a necessary evil.

    If you’re here, Mr. Future Danny, know this: Make things. Explore. Because none of it matters—none of your worries matter. Create awesome things; it doesn’t matter if others don’t find them awesome. Chase the feeling of flow. Don’t prioritize proving yourself to others. I understand the unconscious inclination to do so, but recognize it, catch it, and destroy it. Free yourself from succumbing to the pressure of sacrificing yourself to that unauthentic, distasteful Daniel Richards.
