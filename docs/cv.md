## Projects

#### Unmasking Deep Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection (M.Sc. Thesis)  
  Critically evaluated the need for deep learning models using VAE architectures to detect anomalies in time series data; brought out the need for better benchmark datasets. Investigated the effectiveness of the "point-adjusted" metric used by the research community; highlighted the need for a stable metric to help champion deep learning models. <a href="https://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1823999" target="_blank" style="color: #333; text-decoration: none;"><i class="fa-regular fa-file" style=" vertical-align: middle;"></i></a>

#### Shenanigans with Learnt Representations of Music Taggers  
  Inspected the quality of the GTZAN dataset (public dataset for music genre recognition) using learned representations from multiple deep-learning-based music taggers. Evaluated the clusterability of the learned representations using KNN and GMM for genre classification; Auditorily inspected the generalisability of these music taggers using out-of-distribution data like non-Western music. <a href="https://github.com/Adhithyan8/musical-embeddings" target="_blank" style="color: #333; text-decoration: none;"><i class="fab fa-github" style=" vertical-align: middle;"></i></a>

#### Git Bi-sect: Dissecting Git Re-basin Paper  
  Reproduced the "Git Re-basin" paper (Ainsworth et al.), verifying low loss barrier between deep learning models after removing permutation symmetries; conducted an in-depth analysis to explore the evolution of Linear Mode Connectivity as training progresses; discovered the importance of hyper-parameters on finding permutations; negated claims of methodology not working on MNIST. <a href="https://github.com/dannyrichy/git-bisect" target="_blank" style="color: #333; text-decoration: none;"><i class="fab fa-github" style=" vertical-align: middle;"></i></a>

#### Deep Learning Model Extraction Attack  
  Assessed model extraction attacks on VGG and ResNet models. Designed and implemented an algorithm to identify a core set; investigated the number of samples needed to extract the model. Executed privacy attacks on the extracted model to assess the vulnerability of the victim model. <a href="https://github.com/dannyrichy/dl-model-extraction" target="_blank" style="color: #333; text-decoration: none;"><i class="fab fa-github" style=" vertical-align: middle;"></i></a>

#### Network Representation Learning  
  Performed a comparative study of unsupervised network representation learning algorithms like [LINE](/notes/line-graph-ml.html), [NetMF](/notes/netmf.html), [Node2vec](/notes/node2vec.html), [Deepwalk](/notes.deepwalk.html), and [GraphSage](/notes/graphsage.html) for node classification and link prediction tasks. <a href="https://github.com/dannyrichy/graph-ml-project" target="_blank" style="color: #333; text-decoration: none;"><i class="fab fa-github" style=" vertical-align: middle;"></i></a>

#### Graphons: Efficient Graph Embeddings  
  Explored the effectiveness of Graphons (Random Graph Model) as graph embedding by comparing against Graph2Vec for graph downstream tasks. <a href="https://github.com/dannyrichy/graphon" target="_blank" style="color: #333; text-decoration: none;"><i class="fab fa-github" style=" vertical-align: middle;"></i></a>
