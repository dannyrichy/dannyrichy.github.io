# Daniel Richards ***R.***
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank">Campus Norrköping, Linköping University (LiU), Sweden</a>, under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/gabei62" target="_blank"><strong>Dr Gabriel Eilertsen</strong></a> and 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/danjo37" target="_blank"><strong>Dr [Name]</strong></a>.
  Prior to this, I undertook an internship on <strong>Federated Learning</strong> and <strong>Green Energy</strong> at the 
  <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur" target="_blank">Inria Centre at Université Côte d'Azur, France</a>, with 
  <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/" target="_blank"><strong>Dr Giovanni Neglia</strong></a> and Dr Charlotte Rodriguez.
  I hold an M.Sc. in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> from 
  <a href="https://www.kth.se/" target="_blank">KTH Sweden</a>, and—though seemingly unrelated—a B.Tech in 
  <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Systems Engineering</strong> from 
  <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I enjoy reading about representations, loss landscapes, and the training dynamics of <strong>Deep Learning</strong>.
  While exploring these topics, I realised there were gaps in my knowledge that made it harder to grasp them quickly. I document my attempts to bridge these gaps <a href="/notes.html">here</a>, before they become victims of time’s relentless march.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Outside work, I enjoy watching films, anime, and reading manga (Seinen—just to make it clear I stand apart from the usual dorky crowd). I also engage in the zero-sum activity of watching philosophical videos on YouTube about anything and everything—only to immediately follow them up with videos that bash those exact arguments. And then I wonder why I even bother.
