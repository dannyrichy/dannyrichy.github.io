I am currently exploring the intersection of **Federated Learning** and **Green Energy** at [INRIA, France](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur), working alongside [Dr. Giovanni Neglia](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/) and Dr. Charlotte Rodriguez. I hold an M.Sc. in **Machine Learning** from [KTH Sweden](https://www.kth.se/), and though seemingly unrelated, I also hold a B.Tech in **Mechanical Engineering** with a minor in **Systems Engineering** from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

My true passion lies in **Deep Learning**, particularly the intricate, "under-the-hood" mechanisms that make it tick. Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege to work on fascinating projects, which I‚Äôm eager to share here. This site serves as a way to preserve these experiences and ideas before they fade into the past‚Äîand to be honest, it also helps me keep track of them, considering I tend to forget things as quickly as a goldfish! (A bit selfish, I know, but it works!)
