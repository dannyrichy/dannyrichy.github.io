I am currently exploring the intersection of **Federated Learning** and **Green Energy** at [INRIA, France](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur), working alongside [Dr. Giovanni Neglia](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/) and Dr. Charlotte Rodriguez. I hold an M.Sc. in **Machine Learning** from [KTH Sweden](https://www.kth.se/), and though seemingly unrelated, I also hold a B.Tech in **Mechanical Engineering** with a minor in **Systems Engineering** from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

I am interested in the optimization aspect of **Deep Learning**, and "under-the-hood" mechanisms that power them. Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege to work on interesting projects, which I plan on explaining here. This site serves as a way to preserve these experiences and ideas before they fade into the past‚Äîand it also helps me keep track of them, considering I tend to forget things as quickly as a goldfish! (A bit selfish, I know, but it works!)
