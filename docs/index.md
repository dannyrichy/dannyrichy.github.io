# Daniel Richards ***R.***
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank">Linköping University (LiU), Sweden</a>, where I work on developing tools to understand the inner workings of <strong>Deep Learning</strong>. 
  I am advised by 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/gabjo64" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Gabriel Jönsson</strong></a> and 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/danjo65" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Daniel Jonsson</strong></a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Prior to this, I explored the intersection of <strong>Federated Learning</strong> and <strong>Green Energy</strong> at 
  <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur" target="_blank">INRIA, France</a>, working alongside 
  <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Giovanni Neglia</strong></a> and Dr. Charlotte Rodriguez.
  I hold an M.Sc. in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> from 
  <a href="https://www.kth.se/" target="_blank">KTH Sweden</a>, and though seemingly unrelated, a B.Tech in 
  <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Systems Engineering</strong> from 
  <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In a previous role, I worked as a <em>Business Analytics Consultant</em> and <em>Data Miner</em> for a startup in the recommendation engine space. I also served as a <em>Consultant Data Scientist</em>, focusing on industrial applications. These experiences helped shape my interests and develop my value-system.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am interested in the optimization aspect of <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, and the "under-the-hood" mechanisms that power them. 
  Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege to work on interesting projects, which I plan on explaining here before they become victims of time's relentless march. You can find them <a href="/notes.html">here</a>.
