# Daniel Richards ***R.***
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank">Linköping University (LiU), Sweden</a>, where I develop tools to visualize and better understand the inner workings of <strong>Deep Learning</strong> models. 
  My research focuses on making neural networks more interpretable—peering into their black-box nature to uncover the dynamics behind their learning and decision-making processes. 
  I am fortunate to be advised by 
  <a href="https://liu.se/en/employee/gabei62" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Gabriel Jönsson</strong></a> and 
  <a href="https://liu.se/medarbetare/danjo37" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Daniel Jonsson</strong></a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Prior to this, I explored the intersection of <strong>Federated Learning</strong> and <strong>Green Energy</strong> at 
  <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur" target="_blank">INRIA, France</a>, working with 
  <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Giovanni Neglia</strong></a> and Dr. Charlotte Rodriguez. 
  I hold an M.Sc. in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> from 
  <a href="https://www.kth.se/" target="_blank">KTH Sweden</a>, and a B.Tech in 
  <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Systems Engineering</strong> from 
  <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My earlier roles include working as a <em>Business Analytics Consultant</em> and <em>Data Miner</em> at a recommendation engine startup, as well as a <em>Consultant Data Scientist</em> on industrial AI projects. These stints grounded my approach to applied machine learning and helped shape my research trajectory.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am particularly drawn to the optimization aspects of <strong>Deep Learning</strong> and the mechanisms that operate beneath the surface. I live in Norrköping, Sweden—close to my workplace—and spend a good chunk of time thinking about representations, loss landscapes, and training dynamics. 
  Along the way, I’ve had the chance to work on some engaging projects, which I plan to document <a href="/notes.html">here</a>—before memory fades and files get lost in forgotten directories.
