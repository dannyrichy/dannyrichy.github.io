# Daniel Richards R.

I am currently working on investigating areas related Federated learning and Green energy at [INRIA, France](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur) under [Dr. Giovanni Neglia](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/) and Dr. Charlotte Rodriguez. I obtained my M.Sc. degree in Machine Learning from [KTH Sweden](https://www.kth.se/), and completely unrelated to this I obtained a B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering with minor studies in Systems Engineering from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/)

I am interested in Deep learning especially under-the-hood components. Over the years I have had the opportunity to work on interesting projects which I plan on explaining on this site, lest they become victim to passage of time. Also this is my way to handle the fact that I have a memory of a goldfish (I know so selfish smh).
