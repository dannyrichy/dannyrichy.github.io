<p style="text-align: justify;"> Right now, I'm exploring a subspace where <strong>Federated Learning</strong> meets <strong>Green Energy</strong> at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur" target="_blank">INRIA, France</a>, alongside the awesome <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/" target="_blank"><strong>Dr. Giovanni Neglia</strong></a> and Dr. Charlotte Rodriguez. My academic journey’s been a bit like the trajectory of stochastic gradient descent with a large learning rate—erratic, but definitely exciting. I've earned an M.Sc. in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> from <a href="https://www.kth.se/" target="_blank">KTH Sweden</a>. I heard a gammal kvinna pronounce this as "Ko-Tay-Ho". She was really surprised to find a person from the equatorial region, I mean I was surprised too. Anyway, back to the academics... *<*queue drum roll*>* In an unrelated twist, I also have a B.Tech degree in <strong>Mechanical Engineering</strong> with a minor in <strong>Systems Engineering</strong> from <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT Madras</a>. Tbh, I learnt a lot in my undergrad, from making art with Photoshop and Illustrator (I was a graphic designer for IITM's cultural festival and a handful of startups) to coding in python to data science (maybe this is related to where I have ended up now). I prioritize leading a life that is a mix of logic, creativity, problem-solving, learning about different cultures and a lot of <strong>geeking</strong>. I am happy I developed the habit of exploring completely random things.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> Before all this, I was living the startup life as a <em>Business Analytics Consultant</em> / <em>Data Miner</em> in the world of recommendation engines. But honestly, as with any startup, I wore many hats—from graphic design to coding to data engineering to presenting to clients. I was one of the first folks to design, code, and research on the company's <a href="https://crayondata.ai/the-future-of-ai/" target="_blank">Enterprise Recommender engine</a>. I also took on the role of a <em>Consultant Data Scientist</em>, where I explored how data can help industries smartify their production line. These experiences not only sharpened my technical skills but also honed my soft skills</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> These days, I am interested in understanding the magic behind <strong>Deep Learning</strong>—the hidden gears and mechanisms that make it all tick (I mean, who doesn't love imagining higher-dimensional space and how optimizers move through the weight space?). Along the way, I've worked on some pretty interesting projects. Before time sweeps them away into the abyss of forgotten things. Take a peek at them <a href="/notes">here</a>. </p>
